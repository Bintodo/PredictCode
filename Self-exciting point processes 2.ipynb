    "In (1), an explicitly grid-based self-exciting point process (SEPP) model was considered.  The paper (1) is mostly concerned with two field-trials of the SEPP or epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) type prediction models.  There is no real discussion as to why a grid based model was chosen, compared to the earlier continuous space model using kernel density estimation.\n",
