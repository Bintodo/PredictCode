# Evaluating hotspots

In this folder, we consider ways of comparing the outputs of predictions to what really happened: that is, "scoring" predictions.  We will also, in the future, consider other properties of predictions which might be of interest.

### Introduction

- [Comparing predictions](Comparing%20prediction%20outputs.ipynb)


### Comparison methods

- [Hit rate](Hit%20Rate.ipynb)
- [Likelihood](Likelihood.ipynb)
- [Kernel Density Estimation](Kernel Density Estimation.ipynb)


### Future work

- [Properties of hotspots](Properties of hotspots.ipynb)
