    "# Scoring functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite our reservations about treating our predictions as \"yes/no\" predictions of crime, we can consider using a [Scoring rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule).\n",

    "1. Roberts, \"Assessing the spatial and temporal variation in the skill of precipitation forecasts from an NWP model\" [DOI:10.1002/met.57](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/met.57/abstract)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical e.g. [Brier score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) is appropriate when we have a sequence of events $i$ which either may occur or not.  Let $p_i$ be our predicted probability that event $i$ will occur, and let $o_i$ be the $1$ if the event occurred, and $0$ otherwise.  The Brier score is\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i - o_i)^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper [1] considers aggregating this over different (spatial) scales.  For the moment, we shall use [1] by analogy only, in order to deal with the problem that we might have repeated events ($o_i$ for us is the number of events to occur in a cell, so may be $>1$).  We shall follow [1], vaguely, and let $u_i$ be the _fraction_ of the total number of events which occurred in spatial region (typically, grid cell) $i$.  The score is then\n",
    "$$ S = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i - u_i)^2 $$\n",
    "where we sum over all spatial units $i=1,\\cdots,N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this is related to the KDE method.  We can think of the values $(u_i)$ as a histogram estimation of the real probability density, and then $S$ is just the mean squared error, estimating the continuous version\n",
    "$$ \\int_{\\Omega} (p(x) - f(x))^2 \\ dx $$\n",
    "where $\\Omega$ is the study area.  If we divide by the area of $\\Omega$, then we obtain a measure of difference which is invariant under rescaling of $\\Omega$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The values $(p_i)$, as probabilities, sum to $1$, and the $(u_i)$ by definition sum to $1$.  We hence see that an appropriate normalisation factor for $S$ is\n",
    "$$ S = \\frac{1}{NA} \\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i - u_i)^2 $$\n",
    "where $A$ is the area of each grid cell and so $NA$ is the total area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skill scores\n",
    "\n",
    "A related [Skill score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecast_skill) is\n",
    "$$ SS = 1 - \\frac{S}{S_\\text{worst}}  = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i - u_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i^2 + u_i^2}\n",
    "= \\frac{2\\sum_{i=1}^N p_iu_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^N p_i^2 + u_i^2}. $$\n",
    "Here\n",
    "$$ S_\\text{worst} = \\frac{1}{NA} \\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i^2 + u_i^2) $$\n",
    "is the worst possible value for $S$ if there is no spatial association between the $(p_i)$ and $(u_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-scale issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, [1] considers a multi-scale measure by aggregating the values $(p_i)$ and $(u_i)$ over larger and larger areas.\n",
    "- Firstly we use $(p_i)$ and $(u_i)$ as is, on a grid of size $n\\times m$ say.  So $N=nm$.\n",
    "- Now take the \"moving average\" or \"sliding window\" by averaging over each $2\\times 2$ block.  This gives a grid of size $(n-1) \\times (m-1)$\n",
    "- And so on...\n",
    "- Ending with just the average of $p_i$ over all the whole grid compared to the average of $u_i$ over the whole grid.  These will always agree.\n",
    "- If the grid is not square, then we will stop before this.  Similarly, non-rectangular regions will need to be dealt with in an ad-hoc fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we should not forget to normalise correctly-- at each stage, the \"averaged\" values should still sum to $1$ (being probabilities) and we should continue to divide by the total area."
