kernels
~~~~~~~

For us, a "kernel" is simply a non-normalised probability density function.
We use kernels extensively to represent (conditional) intensity functions in
point processes.

More formally, a kernel is any python object which is callable (e.g. a
function, or an instance of a class implementing `__call__`).  We follow the
e.g. scipy convention:

- A kernel expecting a one dimensional input may take a scalar as input,
  or a one-dimensional numpy array.  It should return, respectively, a scalar
  or a one-dimensional array of the same size.  For example::

    def gaussian(p):
        return np.exp(-p * p)

  Here we use `np.exp` to make sure that if `p` is an array, we handle it
  correctly.

- A kernel expecting a `k` dimensional input may take an array of shape `(k)`
  to represent a point, or an array of shape `(k,N)` to represent `N` points.
  The return should be, respectively, a scalar or an array of shape `(N)`.
  We follow this convention to allow e.g. the following::

   def x_y_sum(p):
       return p[0] + p[1]

  In the single-point case, `p[0]` is a scalar representing the x coordinate and
  `p[1]` a scalar representing the y coordinate.  In the multiple point case,
  `p[0]` is an array of all the x coordinates.
