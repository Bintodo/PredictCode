# Chicago case study

Re-create the Rosser et al. paper using the Chicago data.  Notebooks in order they should be run / investigated:

- [Input data](Input%20data.ipynb) : Collects and processes the data we need
- [Hotspotting.ipynb](Hotspotting.ipynb) : Demonstrates making hotspots on a network with the two prediction methods.
- [Grid to network hotspotting.ipynb](Grid%20to%20network%20hotspotting.ipynb) : Demonstrates how to take a grid based prediction and produce a network based hotspot map.
- [Cross-Validation.ipynb](Cross-Validation.ipynb) : Perform cross-validation to find the "optimal" bandwidths, for the network prediction.
- [Cross-Validation grid](Cross-Validation%20grid.ipynb) : Same, but using a grid based predictor.
- [Grid Network Comparison.ipynb](Grid%20Network%20Comparison.ipynb) : Compare the network and grid based predictions using hit rate.
