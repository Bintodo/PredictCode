    "- We need geometry giving the street network we'll work on.\n",
    "  - For the moment, we use freely available data from the [OS Open Road](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/os-open-roads.html) for the UK, and [TIGER/Line](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html) for the USA.\n",
    "  - For us, a \"network\" or \"graph\" is a collection of vertices in the plane, with edges connecting (some of) the vertices, as straight lines.  Informally, the \"network\" is the subset of the plane formed by the union of all the edges.  Curved streets can be approximated by adding further vertices.  This usage correlates with the above geometry sources.\n",
    "- All events need to be assigned to the network.  Following (1) we simply orthogonally project each event to the network (this is equivalent as assigning each event to the closest point on the network).\n",
    "- We then \"simply\" change the grid-based hotspotting technique to work on the network, using (2).  We give details below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting \"hotspot\" is actually a \"risk\" estimate for each point on the network, where a higher risk corresponds to the belief that future events are more likely.  As usual, we generate an actual \"hotspot(s)\" by chosing a \"coverage level\", say 10%, and then selecting the 10% of the network which is most risky, where we use the natural length of edges in the network to decide what \"10%\" means.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might naturally want to compare such a prediction with a grid-based prediction.  To do this, (1) suggests (although they don't quite use these words) generating a network prediction from a grid prediction.  We do this by giving edge network point the \"risk\" of the grid cell it occurs in.  Once this is done, we can then compare network predictions directly.  (For example, to generate 10% coverage, we work from most risky to least risky grid cell, adding all the network which intersects with that cell, until we have selected 10% of the network by length.)"

    "We follow (2); the summary in (1) is very clear.  Let $s'$ be an event on the network.  We seek to derive a formula for the (space-like) kernel induced at a point $s$.  As a base, we start with a one-dimensional kernel function $f:\\mathbb R\\rightarrow [0,\\infty)$.  We assume that $f$ is symmetric, $f(-t) = f(t)$, and it should be normalised, $\\int_{\\mathbb R} f(t) \\ dt = 1$.  (Source (2) gives further conditions, but these are details, and will be satisfied by our kernels.)  We always suppose our kernels have a finite \"support\", a value $t_\\max$ such that $f(t)=0$ for any $|t|>t_\\max$.\n",

    "(1) considers a \"prospective\" hotspotting technique, which takes account of time.  We consider forming a prediction at time $t$.  Consider events which occur at time $t_i$ for $i=1,\\cdots,n$, and which occur at a place $s_i$ on the network.  We combine a time and space kernel.\n",
    "\n",

    "We are interested in an estimate of the risk at a fixed time $t$.  Source (1) suggests sampling $\\lambda(s) = \\lambda(s,t)$ at various points $s$ across the network; (1) suggests every 30 metres.  We make some comments on how to improve this, and towards efficient computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we are only sampling at points, then we may as well actually just deem every edge in the network to have a risk which is constant across that edge.  If an edge is too long, then it can simply be split into parts by adding addition vertices.\n",
    "- Thus, we will assign, say, the risk at the _centre_ of each edge to the whole edge.\n",
    "- To correctly normalise, we should multiply this point risk by the length of the edge.  An alternative, if the form of the spacial kernel is analytically tractable, is to integrate it over the edge.\n",
    "- It is more efficient to work over each event at time $t_i<t$ in turn, performing the \"walk\" across the network from that point, adding to the risk of each edge as we encounter it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find all paths between a point in the middle of an edge between vertices $u_1, u_2$ and a point in the middle of an edge between vertices $u_3, u_4$, we can proceed as follows:\n",
    "- Decide we will first move to vertex $u_1$, and will finally move to vertex $u_3$.\n",
    "- Find all such paths, ignoring any path which uses the edges between $u_1, u_2$ and $u_3, u_4$, to avoid circular paths.\n",
    "- Do the for paths $u_1 \\rightarrow u_4$, then $u_2\\rightarrow u_3$ and finally $u_2\\rightarrow u_4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, once we have summed all the \"risks\" for each edge, we should normalise and divide by the length of the edge.\n",
    "- This assigns to each edge the average/expected risk.\n",
    "- We can then e.g. take the top 10% of edges to form network \"hotspots\"\n",
