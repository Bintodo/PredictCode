    "- Each hotspot is of a maxmimum size (number of grid cells).  Or the total coverage is limited.\n",
    "- At the very least, a \"hotspot\" must be a contiguous selections of cells.\n",

    "In either case, our goal is to find the selection of cells (or edges) which satisfies the above constraints, and subject to this constraint, maximises the sum of risks.  This is probably computationally intractible, and so algorithms which get close to the maximum will be sought."
