# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on GitHub
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do other predictors
    - Think all but SEPP, which don't 100% work, are now done.
  - Should we adjust the "samples" value when converting from a continuous to grid based prediction, based on the grid size,
    to keep the total number of samples (per unit area) constant?

- Session saving/loading
  - Display the name of the current session file...
  - New dialog to select a recent session

- UI issues:
  - 1% of the time, the date-time picker fails to display on Windows.
