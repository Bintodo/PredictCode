# Main code

- Could think about how best to produce a "prediction" from an SEPP method:
  - Say we want predict the next week.  Is a "point" estimate appropriate, or should we somehow "integrate" over time??
  - After a bit of thought, this seems complicated (even e.g. for a time-only Hawkes process).  Which is
     perhaps why other authors haven't addressed it.

- Start work on network based framework.
  - Have the base code working fairly well, though it needs polishing


# GUI

- Awaiting input from colleagues on "evaluation" techniques before I do too much work which
  might not be useful.

- Network support:
  - Allowing importing of geometry
    - Add a "remove geometry" button
    - Add in the cropping option (from `geo_crop`)
    - Modify `geo_crop` to allow using the global settings
    - Need a preview with the data points as well

- Base map support:
  - Start integrating `tilemapbase` and add configuration options


- On work LINUX machine, I am now seeing a separate "Toplevel" window.  Can I replicate on Ubunutu??



## Very low priority
