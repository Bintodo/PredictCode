# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly



# GUI

BUG: If focus is off the application when it tries to display a top-level window,
  the window goes missing.  On Windows.

- Predictors:
  - Do the 2 naive predictors
  - Grid generator

- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session

- Would be nice to bind the scroll wheel to a vertical scroll bar...
