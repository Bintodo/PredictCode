# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly



# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do the 2 naive predictors

- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session

- Would be nice to bind the scroll wheel to a vertical scroll bar...

- Would be nice if in `mtp.py` we can get away without needing PIL.
  - Can load a photo image, but cannot rescale. 
  - So need to change code to recompute the figure with a suitable dpi
