# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly



# GUI

BUG: If focus is off the application when it tries to display a top-level window,
  the window goes missing.  Fixed on windows.  Test on Linux/X windows.

- Predictors:
  - Raise error if a lonlat projector is selected on projected data.
    - Then catch this and display a message in the analysis view class
  - Grid generator
    - Fix the memory leak.  But it's still slow.  Is there a better way to
      draw?
  - Do the 2 naive predictors

- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session

- Would be nice to bind the scroll wheel to a vertical scroll bar...

- Would be nice if in `mtp.py` we can get away without needing PIL.
  - Can load a photo image, but cannot rescale. 
  - So need to change code to recompute the figure with a suitable dpi

- Don't use pyplot, as it leads to memory leaks.  See https://stackoverflow.com/a/12300012/3403507
