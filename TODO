# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do the 2 naive predictors


- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session

- Would be nice to bind the scroll wheel to a vertical scroll bar...
