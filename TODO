# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly



# GUI

- Session saving/loading
   - Still need to load crime selections correctly
   - Actually, I think the current display system for 2 levels doesn't really make sense...
     - It's broken, as we store the cartesian product.  We could fix this, but it stil leaves the interface in a confusing way.
     - Would be better to make the widget wider, and display all pairs.  This simplifies the view / controller
   - New dialog to select a recent session
- Analysis.Model now has _errors.  Consume/display these.
   - Add error(s) if we have too many crime types.
- Change process_file so that:
   - Allow changing the buttons at the bottom to be more suitable for reloading...
