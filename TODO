# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on GitHub
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do other predictors
  - Tests for the predictors (just test that the settings we _think_ we are applying get passed to the main `open_cp` code correctly.)

- geo_clip:
  - Test!
  - Use in the run_analysis code (add a post-step after the prediction, for efficiency).


- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session
