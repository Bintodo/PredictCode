# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly
- Add some logging functionality in the library


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Finish browser view
  - Do the 2nd naive predictors
  - Do other predictors

- Store which analysis files have been saved, and their filename, in the "session".
  - Adjust the "save" icon and tooltip text to show that file is already saved.




- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session

- Would be nice to bind the scroll wheel to a vertical scroll bar...
