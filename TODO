# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on GitHub
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly


# GUI

- Finish testing hit_rate.py

- Integrate into and test with the comparison

- Add new "browse view" for results of the comparison

- In the prediction browse view add ability to use a geometry clipper...

- Predictors:
  - Do other predictors
  - Tests for the predictors (just test that the settings we _think_ we are applying get passed to the main `open_cp` code correctly.)
  - Should we adjust the "samples" value when converting from a continuous to grid based prediction, based on the grid size,
    to keep the total number of samples (per unit area) constant?

- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session

- UI issues:
  - 1% of the time, the date-time picker fails to display on Windows.
