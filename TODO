# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do other predictors
  - Tests for the predictors (just test that the settings we _think_ we are applying get passed to the main `open_cp` code correctly.)




- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session
