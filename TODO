# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly
- Add some logging functionality in the library


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do the 2 naive predictors

- If an exception is thrown in a thread, we log it:

But then we don't do anything.  Should signal back somehow...


- Session saving/loading
