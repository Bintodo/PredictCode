# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on github
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly



# GUI

- Finish comparitors list etc.
- Add comparitor "One day period, Three day period, week etc."

- Predictors:
  - Do the 2 naive predictors

Pipeline of running:
- Find the projectors to use.  For each projector:
- Find the grids to use.  For each grid:
- Generate the prediction tasks.
- Then generate tasks from these, and run them.
- Each one should produce a "raw" projection: a timestamp of the projection, and an instance of GridPrediction
- Everything else should go under "analysis"

Would be good to have a way to capture non-fatal warnings.
- For example, most predictors will generate one prediction per day, so any time (as opposed to date) data in
the "assessment time range" will be ignored.  (Aside: make this a base-class method).
- Maybe write a custom logger which redirects to a window??




- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session

- Would be nice to bind the scroll wheel to a vertical scroll bar...
