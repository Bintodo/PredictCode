# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on GitHub
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly

- Could think about how best to produce a "prediction" from an SEPP method:
  - Say we want predict the next week.  Is a "point" estimate appropriate, or should we somehow "integrate" over time??


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do other predictors
    - Think all but SEPP, which don't 100% work, are now done.
    - Currently working on the `seppexp` method.  Needs tests.
- Would be useful to have some mechanism for a "predictor" to communicate log details back to the main task.
