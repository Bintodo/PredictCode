# GUI

- Session saving/loading
   - Still need to load crime selections correctly
   - New dialog to select a recent session
- Analysis.Model now has _errors.  Consume/display these.
   - Add error(s) if we have too many crime types.
- Change process_file so that:
   - If we don't know the row count, compute it first
   - Allow changing the buttons at the bottom to be more suitable for reloading...
