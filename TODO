# Main code

- Sort out convergence issues in SEPP code
   - See comment on GitHub
- Look at the grid-based SEPP method which seems to perform badly


# GUI

- Predictors:
  - Do other predictors
    - Think all but SEPP, which don't 100% work, are now done.
  - Should we adjust the "samples" value when converting from a continuous to grid based prediction, based on the grid size,
    to keep the total number of samples (per unit area) constant?

- Session saving/loading
  - New dialog to select a recent session (and mechanism to save these...)

- UI issues:
  - 1% of the time, the date-time picker fails to display on Windows.  
  - Can re-create this consistently by running the `snippets\modal.py` script, clicking to open the date picker, then clicking
    on another window, and then clicking back.  After this, the date picker will fail to display again.
  - Fixed on Windows by moving the call to `self.wm_overrideredirect(True)` to the end.
  - Need to check if this works on linux (it didn't, have moved the offending line up before we add widgets).  Cannot re-create the main problem on linux.
  - Next attempt: Moved the `transient` command to the end, which again fixes it on Windows.
  - Test again on X/Linux
